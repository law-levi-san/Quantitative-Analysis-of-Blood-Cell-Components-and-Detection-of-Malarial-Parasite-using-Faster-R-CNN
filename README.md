# Quantitative-Analysis-of-Blood-Cell-Components-and-Detection-of-Malarial-Parasite(P Vivax) using-Faster-R-CNN

This project introduces an advanced automated system utilizing the Faster R-CNN 
architecture for precise detection of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells 
(WBCs), platelets, and the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax in blood smear 
images. To enhance our dataset, we employ two types of Generative Adversarial 
Networks (GANs)-one to generate new, diverse images and Real ESRGAN to 
improve the resolution and quality of these images, thereby increasing the 
robustness and performance of our system. Aimed at aiding medical professionals 
in diagnosing blood disorders and malaria, our system provides rapid and reliable 
microscopic sample analysis. Extensive experimentation confirms our method's 
efficacy in accurately identifying various blood components and malaria parasites, 
demonstrating its potential to revolutionize medical diagnostics and significantly 
improve patient outcomes in hematology and infectious diseases.
